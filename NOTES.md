External readings:
Temperature (Celcius)
Wind speed and direction (kmph, geographical direction)
Pressure (Pascals)
Dust (ug/m3)
Sun and UV radiation (W/m2)
Seismic activity (m/s2)

Internal readings (per room):
Integrity (%, structural)

Filters room:
OxygenPerTick (percentage point)

Reactor room:
EnergyPerTick (percentage point)

Storage room:
Calories (kcal)
Water (litres)
Energy (%)

Base readings:
Oxygen (%, relative, 100% is actually 21% in regular air mixture)  
Humidity (%, relative)
Temperature (Celcius)

Human readings:
Health (%, depends on oxygen, food, water)

Rooms:
Filters (generates oxygen from atmosphere, needs electricity)
Reactor (generates electricity, needs fuel which is stored in storage)
Panic (if overall integrity is critically low, evacuation is issued)
Greenhouse (generates food from water and electricity)
Barracks (humans sleep there)
Storage (stores food and fuel)

KG --> MKG:  
WMars = (WEarth / 9.81) * 3.2

Initial simulation variables:
Water (litres)
Calories (kcal)
Fuel (kg, probably some radioactive isotope)
Workers (amount)
